        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. <br>
            Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as<br>
            ragù, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.<br>
            The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled <br>
            with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground beef </li>
            <li>½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce </li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes </li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped </li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper </li>
            <li>2 cups dried malfada noodles </li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.<br> 
                Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
